# Credit_Card_Segmentation

As my master education completed and no longer a student, the very first financial tool I obtained is credit card. In nowadays business environment, bank segments customers and provides all kinds of credit card. Different types of credit card provide different levels of benefits and advantages. Hence, to understand what kind of benefit I could receive based on my income and basic information, I decide to create a classification model to predict the level of card customer would received.  
     
In this project, I will try several different models, such as NN, XGBoost, and LGBM. In addition, to compare the performance of different models and find the best hyperparameter combination, I will use Nested Cross-Validation, Cross-Validation, Grid-Search, and Random-Search techniques.
